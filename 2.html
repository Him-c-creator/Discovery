<p>The W11 took thirteen wins (eleven for Hamilton and two for Bottas), 
fifteen pole positions (ten for Hamilton and five for Bottas), 
nine fastest laps (six for Hamilton, two for Bottas and one for Russell),
 twelve front-row lockouts and five 1–2 finishes across 17 races. 
With it, Mercedes secured a seventh consecutive Formula One World Constructor's 
Championship, breaking a record for consecutive championships previously held by Ferrari.
 Due to its setting numerous track records (the outright fastest lap ever) at various
 Formula One circuits, the W11 is considered to be one of the greatest race cars of all
 time.</p>
<p>The W11 has a system which Mercedes had developed called Dual-Axis Steering (DAS)
 which allowed the driver to adjust the toe of the front wheels to optimise mechanical
 grip by pulling or pushing on the steering wheel. DAS allowed the drivers to warm the
 car's tyres more efficiently by having a zero toe but allows for better cornering 
ability by using a negative toe, a feature which was of particular significance on 
circuits with long straights.[13] DAS was removed from the car after the 2020 
championship as the system was banned for 2021.</p>
